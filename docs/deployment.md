# Deploying Forge Applications

Status: Phase 1. This guide covers what a generated application provides today:
a container image, a standalone binary, environment configuration, health
endpoints and graceful shutdown. The examples use an application named `shop`.
Kubernetes and systemd snippets are starting points to review, not certified
configurations. Forge does not generate a deployment tool yet
([ADR 0009](adr/0009-rails-style-generated-delivery-assets.md)).

## Container image

`forge new` generates a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (unless `--skip-docker` is
used; see [ADR 0008](adr/0008-docker-by-default.md)).

**Builder stage**
- Image: `rust:<pinned toolchain>-slim-trixie` (Debian 13), selected by
  `ARG RUST_VERSION`. The generated `tests/container.rs` fails if that value
  differs from `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- `.dockerignore` excludes `rust-toolchain.toml` (along with build output), so
  the builder uses the image's preinstalled toolchain instead of downloading
  components.
- Build: `cargo build --release --locked`, with BuildKit cache mounts for the
  Cargo registry and target directory.
- Needs a committed `Cargo.lock`, so a stale or missing lockfile fails the build
  instead of re-resolving dependencies.

**Runtime stage**
- Image: `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian13:nonroot`. It has no shell and no package
  manager. It contains C runtime libraries, CA certificates and the application
  binary.
- User: numeric non-root uid/gid `65532`.
- Environment: `FORGE_ENV=production` and `FORGE_BIND=0.0.0.0:3000`.
- Port: `EXPOSE 3000`.
- `HEALTHCHECK` (exec form) runs `<binary> healthcheck`, which probes
  `GET /health/live` over loopback.
- `ENTRYPOINT` is the binary itself (exec form). It runs as PID 1 and receives
  `SIGTERM` directly, with no shell wrapper.

Build and run:

```sh
docker build -t shop .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  --read-only --cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  shop
curl localhost:3000/health/live
docker ps   # STATUS shows (healthy) once the HEALTHCHECK passes
```

Because the image has no shell, `docker exec -it <container> sh` does not work.
Debug with logs, the health endpoints, or an ephemeral debug container that
shares the process namespace.

### Compose (local convenience)

The generated `compose.yaml` builds the image and publishes it on
`127.0.0.1:3000` only (not on all host interfaces). It sets
`stop_grace_period: 20s` (longer than the default 15-second drain) and applies `read_only: true`, a `tmpfs` at `/tmp`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`,
`security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]` and `init: true`. It is for local runs
and has no database service yet (PostgreSQL arrives in Phase 2). Compose is not
Forge's production orchestration contract.

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

### Pinning base images for release builds

The generated `Dockerfile` references base images by tag, and generated
Dependabot configuration proposes updates. For release or certification builds,
pin both stages by immutable digest and keep the tag for readability
([dependency policy](dependency-policy.md#supply-chain-gates)):

```sh
docker buildx imagetools inspect rust:1.98.1-slim-trixie
docker buildx imagetools inspect gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian13:nonroot
```

```dockerfile
FROM rust:${RUST_VERSION}-slim-trixie@sha256:<digest> AS builder
# ...
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian13:nonroot@sha256:<digest>
```

Dependabot's `docker` ecosystem can update a `tag@digest` reference while
keeping the tag. Scan the final image before publishing it.

## Configuration

Configuration comes only from environment variables and is validated before the
server starts. Invalid values stop startup with an error. **Unknown `FORGE_*`
variables are rejected** in every environment, so a typo such as `FORGE_BIDN`
fails startup instead of being silently ignored. Remove stale `FORGE_*` entries
from env files, Kubernetes manifests and unit files.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FORGE_ENV` | `development` | `development`, `test` or `production`. Selects safety-sensitive defaults such as the log format. |
| `FORGE_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:3000` | Listen socket address. The container image sets `0.0.0.0:3000`. |
| `FORGE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `30` | Maximum time for one request, including reading the request body. |
| `FORGE_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS` | `15` | Drain deadline for in-flight requests after SIGTERM/SIGINT. |
| `FORGE_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `1048576` | Maximum request body size in bytes. |
| `FORGE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `10000` | Maximum concurrent connections. Extra connections wait for a slot (backpressure) instead of being served without bound. |
| `FORGE_LOG` | `info` | `tracing` filter directive, for example `info,shop=debug`. |
| `FORGE_LOG_FORMAT` | `json` in production, `text` otherwise | `json` or `text`. |

Logs go to standard output, and the platform (Docker, Kubernetes, journald)
collects them. The HTTP layer also enforces a header-read timeout and adds
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and a UUIDv7
`x-request-id` to responses. Transient `accept` errors, such as running out of
file descriptors, do not stop the server.

Do not put secrets in the image or in build arguments. Phase 1 has no secret
settings. Secret references arrive with the features that need them.

## Health endpoints

These routes are always registered:

| Route | Use | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health/live` | Liveness | The process is running and serving HTTP. It never depends on external systems. |
| `GET /health/ready` | Readiness | The instance can accept its configured work. Phase 1 has no external dependencies, so this reflects only the process itself. Later phases add checks for required dependencies. |
| `GET /health` | Summary | Overall health summary. |

Use liveness to decide when to restart and readiness to decide when to route
traffic. Do not point liveness at readiness: a dependency outage should take an
instance out of rotation, not restart it in a loop.

The access-controlled diagnostic behavior for `/health` described in the
[architecture](architecture.md#observability-and-health) is not part of Phase 1.
Assume anyone who can reach the port can reach all three routes.

The `healthcheck` subcommand (`shop healthcheck`) probes `GET /health/live` on
the loopback address of the configured port and exits `0` or `1`. It is meant
for the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` in shell-less images. Orchestrators that do their
own HTTP probing (Kubernetes) should use `httpGet` probes instead. Kubernetes
ignores the image `HEALTHCHECK`.

## Graceful shutdown

On `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`, the application:

1. stops accepting new connections;
2. lets in-flight requests finish, for up to `FORGE_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS`;
3. exits. A graceful shutdown exits with status `0`.

The supervisor's stop timeout must be **longer** than
`FORGE_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS`, or the process is killed (`SIGKILL`) mid-drain:

| Platform | Setting | Default | Recommendation (grace 15 s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docker | `docker stop -t <secs>` | 10 s | `docker stop -t 20 <container>` |
| Compose | `stop_grace_period` | 10 s | `20s` (set by the generated `compose.yaml`) |
| Kubernetes | `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | 30 s | `30` |
| systemd | `TimeoutStopSec` | 90 s (distribution default) | `30` |

Docker's default 10-second stop timeout is **shorter** than the default 15-second
grace, so pass `-t` to plain `docker stop` when long requests matter. If you
raise `FORGE_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS`, raise every stop timeout above it as well.

## Read-only root filesystem

The application writes nothing to its filesystem in Phase 1. It runs with a
read-only root filesystem (`docker run --read-only`, Compose `read_only: true`,
Kubernetes `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`). The generated Compose file mounts a
`tmpfs` at `/tmp` for libraries that expect a writable temporary directory. The
Kubernetes example below mounts an `emptyDir` at `/tmp` for the same reason.
Features that need persistent writes must declare an explicit volume.

## Kubernetes

A starting point for a Deployment. Replace the image with a digest-pinned
reference from your registry.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shop
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shop
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shop
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30   # > FORGE_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS
      automountServiceAccountToken: false
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 65532
        runAsGroup: 65532
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      containers:
        - name: shop
          image: registry.example.com/shop@sha256:<digest>
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: FORGE_ENV
              value: production
            - name: FORGE_BIND
              value: 0.0.0.0:3000
            - name: FORGE_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS
              value: "15"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/live
              port: http
            periodSeconds: 10
            failureThreshold: 3
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/ready
              port: http
            periodSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 2
          securityContext:
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            capabilities:
              drop: ["ALL"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: tmp
              mountPath: /tmp
      volumes:
        - name: tmp
          emptyDir: {}
```

Removing a Pod from Service endpoints happens in parallel with `SIGTERM`, so a
few requests can still arrive after shutdown starts. If that matters, add a
short `preStop` delay. The image has no shell, so `exec` hooks such as
`sleep` are unavailable. Use the native `sleep` lifecycle action if your cluster
version supports it.

Set CPU and memory requests and limits from your own measurements. Forge does
not publish sizing guidance yet.

## systemd (bare metal / VMs)

Build the binary with `forge build` (`cargo build --release --locked`) and copy
`target/release/shop` to the host, for example `/usr/local/bin/shop`. The binary
links against glibc, so build on or for a distribution with a compatible glibc.
The container image does not have this constraint, because it builds and runs
on matching Debian 13 stages.

```ini

systemd-analyze security shop.service
```

Port 3000 is unprivileged, so no capabilities are needed. Put a TLS-terminating
reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the loopback bind. If you use an
`EnvironmentFile=`, it must contain only known `FORGE_*` keys.
