# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs record decisions whose reversal would affect public contracts, security, or
multiple crates. `Accepted` means the design is approved for implementation; it
does not mean implementation exists.

New ADRs use the next four-digit number. A changed decision receives a new ADR
that marks the prior record `Superseded`; accepted records are not rewritten to
hide history. A decision that is extended without being reversed receives a
new ADR that refines the prior one; the prior record stays `Accepted` and gains
only a `Refined by` note.
