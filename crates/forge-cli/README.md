# Forge CLI

`forge` is the command-line entry point for Forge applications.

```text
forge id                         print a UUIDv7
forge new <name> [flags]         create an application
forge check | test | format | lint | build
```

`forge new` creates a standalone Cargo package with Forge's hexagonal module
boundaries, an architecture test and, by default, the delivery assets a
production service needs:

- `Dockerfile` (multi-stage, locked build, distroless non-root runtime,
  self-probing `HEALTHCHECK`), `.dockerignore` and `compose.yaml`;
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fmt, clippy, tests, image build and smoke test)
  and `.github/dependabot.yml`.

Flags: `--skip-docker`, `--skip-ci`, `--skip-lockfile`, and `--forge-path
<PATH>` to depend on a local Forge checkout instead of the release tag.
It refuses to overwrite an existing path. Templates live in `templates/app`;
`examples/hello-forge` is their committed output and a unit test fails when
the two drift (`FORGE_BLESS=1 cargo test -p forge-cli` regenerates it).

The quality commands run Cargo directly in the current directory; no shell is
involved. See [docs/cli.md](../../docs/cli.md) for the full reference.
