//! Forge application facade.
//!
//! Generated applications depend on this crate only. [`App`] owns the process
//! lifecycle: command-line dispatch, configuration loading, logging, the Tokio
//! runtime, signal handling, graceful shutdown, and the container health probe.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use forge::http::{Method, Response, StatusCode};
//!
//! fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode {
//!     forge::App::new("my-service")
//!         .version(env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))
//!         .routes(|router| {
//!             router.route(Method::GET, "/hello", |_| async {
//!                 Response::new(StatusCode::OK, "hello")
//!             })?;
//!             Ok(())
//!         })
//!         .run()
//! }
//! ```
